# Case Study: How does a bike share navigate speedy success?

This project is the capstone assignment for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The program prepares participants for a career in data analytics with training focused on key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, and visualization) and tools (Excel, SQL, R Programming, Tableau).

This project will analyze publicly available datasets, provided by the course, for a bikeshare program based in Chicago. The case study can be viewed on [my portfolio site](https://ananfito.github.io/case-study_cyclistic/case_study_01_cyclistic.html), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anthonynanfito/cyclistic-bike-share-a-case-study), or [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/anthonynanfito/case_study_cyclistic)
